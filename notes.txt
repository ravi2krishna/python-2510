    -> Python : Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
    Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of 
    significant indentation. Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected.

    -> Programming Language : To Communicate with Machines(Computers) 

    -> Human To Human : English, Hindi, Telugu etc

    -> Human To Machine : Programming Language

    -> Machines use : Binary Language (101010101)

        -> 01110000 01111001 01110100 01101000 01101111 01101110

        -> Easy for humans to understand 

        -> Designed for Application Development 

        -> Slow Execution

    -> Low Level Programming Languages

        -> Difficult for humans to understand  

        -> Designed for Hardware Level(Embedded Systems)

        -> Fast Execution

    -> General-purpose programming language

        -> Work with 

            -> Desktop Applications
            -> Web Applications

            -> etc 

    -> Domain Specific programming language

        -> SQL - Structured Query Language is a domain-specific language 
            used to manage data, especially in a relational database management system.

            -> SQL - Only for data management inside databases 


    -> Programming Paradigms 

        -> Structure the implementation of a computer program

        -> Python is a Multi Paradigm programming language

            -> Imperative Style / Approach

                -> How To Do (Task/Action)

                -> w.r.t python OOPS 

            -> Declarative Style / Approach

                -> What To Do (Task/Action)

    -> Hardware 

        -> i3 / i5(*) processor 
        -> 8 GB RAM at least
        -> 500 GB of HDD

    -> Softwares 

        -> System Softwares (OS)

            -> Win / Linux / Unix(macos)

                -> Install Python (Python Interpreter)

                    -> Making your system capable of running python code

                -> Install IDE (Integrated Development Environment) 

                    -> For writing code 

                    -> With IDE's you got support for 

                        -> Auto Code Completion

                        -> Syntax Highlighting

                        -> External Extensions (Plugins)

                        -> Debugging tools etc

                    -> Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

                -> Install Git (Version Controlling - Code Tracking)

                    -> For Code Tracking

                    -> Git can track code in your workstation (Your Laptop)

                    -> GitHub : Platform from microsoft to store the code of a project

                        -> We have 5 developers, all the 5 developers will have their own 
                        Laptops, in their individual laptops they will install git (client)    

                        -> All the 5 developers, when they have completed their work, using
                            git they will upload all their code to GitHub

        -> NOTE : Integrate VS Code --> Git --> GitHub 

            -> VS Code (Write Code)
            -> Git     (Track Code)
            -> GitHub  (Store Code)
