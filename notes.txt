    -> Python : Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
    Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of 
    significant indentation. Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected.

    -> Programming Language : To Communicate with Machines(Computers) 

    -> Human To Human : English, Hindi, Telugu etc

    -> Human To Machine : Programming Language

    -> Machines use : Binary Language (101010101)

        -> 01110000 01111001 01110100 01101000 01101111 01101110

    -> Python is a high-level language

        -> Easy for humans to understand 

        -> Designed for Application Development 

        -> Slow Execution

    -> Low Level Programming Languages

        -> Difficult for humans to understand  

        -> Designed for Hardware Level(Embedded Systems)

        -> Fast Execution

    -> General-purpose programming language

        -> Work with 

            -> Desktop Applications
            -> Web Applications
            -> API Development
            -> etc 

    -> Domain Specific programming language

        -> SQL - Structured Query Language is a domain-specific language 
            used to manage data, especially in a relational database management system.

            -> SQL - Only for data management inside databases 


    -> Programming Paradigms 

        -> Structure the implementation of a computer program

        -> Python is a Multi Paradigm programming language

            -> Imperative Style / Approach

                -> How To Do (Task/Action)

                -> w.r.t python OOPS 

            -> Declarative Style / Approach

                -> What To Do (Task/Action)

                -> w.r.t python Functional Programming 


    -> Hardware 

        -> i3 / i5(*) processor 
        -> 8 GB RAM at least
        -> 500 GB of HDD

    -> Softwares 

        -> System Softwares (OS)

            -> Win / Linux / Unix(macos)

                -> Install Python (Python Interpreter)

                    -> Making your system capable of running python code

                -> Install IDE (Integrated Development Environment) 

                    -> For writing code 

                    -> With IDE's you got support for 

                        -> Auto Code Completion

                        -> Syntax Highlighting

                        -> External Extensions (Plugins)

                        -> Debugging tools etc

                    -> Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

                -> Install Git (Version Controlling - Code Tracking)

                    -> For Code Tracking

                    -> Git can track code in your workstation (Your Laptop)

                    -> GitHub : Platform from microsoft to store the code of a project

                        -> We have 5 developers, all the 5 developers will have their own 
                        Laptops, in their individual laptops they will install git (client)    

                        -> All the 5 developers, when they have completed their work, using
                            git they will upload all their code to GitHub

        -> NOTE : Integrate VS Code --> Git --> GitHub 

            -> VS Code (Write Code)
            -> Git     (Track Code)
            -> GitHub  (Store Code)

=============

-> Install Python 

    -> Verify using : python --Version

-> Start Writing Python Code

    -> Script Mode (100%)

        -> Using Files / Using IDE

        -> NOTE : Files are permanently stored on disk, and later pushed to Github

    -> Command Line Mode / Interactive Mode (Quick Checks)

        -> No files, directly working with Interpreter

        -> NOTE : The values are expressions are only valid for that particular session only,
            once we close the session/window, values are obsolete 

    -> Like English has 26 alphabets, which forms the whole english language

    -> In python we have keywords (35)

        -> keywords + Syntax = program / application

    -> keywords - hold special meaning to python 

    ->  False      await      else       import     pass
        None       break      except     in         raise
        True       class      finally    is         return
        and        continue   for        lambda     try
        as         def        from       nonlocal   while
        assert     del        global     not        with
        async      elif       if         or         yield    


-> Identifiers

    -> An Identifier in python is a name used to Identify

        -> variable
        -> function
        -> class
        -> object 
        -> method
        -> etc

    -> Rules for naming Identifiers in python

        -> Can Contain:

            -> Letters (a-z, A-Z) 
            -> Digits(0-9)
            -> Only Underscore(_)

        -> Must Start with:

            -> A letter (a-z, A-Z)
            -> A Underscore(_)

        -> Cannot start with Digit
        -> Cannot be a keyword 
        -> Case Sensitive - name, Name, NAME     

-> Variables

    -> Variables are names for memory locations

        -> Memory (Physically) - RAM 

        -> Disk (Storing Files)

    -> A variable will allow you to

        -> Assign Data
        -> Manipulate Data (If Required)
        -> Retrieve Data

    -> Syntax 

        -> variable_name = value
           course_duration = 35

           = Assignment Operator 


    -> NOTE : use id() to get memory locations of Variables

    -> NOTE : use type() to get the type of data
